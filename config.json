      "bio": "Peter Mayfield is a long-term social entrepreneur deeply passionate about the transformative benefits people experience through a profound connection with nature. He has journeyed from two decades as a world-class rock climber and guide (1978–1998) to founding and growing CityRock, the world's first full-service climbing gym (1990–1996). Peter then launched Yosemite Guides, offering eco-tours for park visitors and environmental literacy field trips for school groups (1998–2004). In 2006, Peter founded Gateway Mountain Center, an innovative nonprofit that has served more than 30,000 youth through environmental literacy, mountain adventure, and nature-based sensory immersion programs at Donner Summit. At Gateway, he developed a clinically supervised, nature-based therapeutic mentoring program for youth and young adults facing severe emotional disturbance, complex trauma, and substance dependence. This became the first program of its kind in the U.S. to secure County Behavioral Health contracts and Medicaid reimbursement, marking a breakthrough in integrating nature-based therapy into mainstream mental health care. Today, Peter is channeling his decades of experience into Nature Up Health, advancing proven nature-based methods and systems to improve health and wellbeing at scale."

  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Why is this market opportunity attractive?",
        "answer": "The market is attractive because: (1) Structural crisis, not cyclical - youth mental health rates continue rising; (2) Genuine gap in care - no post-hospitalization options in Northern CA; (3) Multiple payers seeking solutions - counties, hospitals, insurance companies all motivated; (4) Demonstrated demand - Gateway has waitlists for similar programs; (5) Growing national trend toward nature-based therapy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you know there's demand?",
        "answer": "Demand validation comes from: (1) Gateway's existing relationships with 20+ county behavioral health departments and hospitals; (2) Letters of support from potential referral sources; (3) Industry reports showing 57% relapse rates and gap in post-hospitalization care; (4) Payer interest in step-down alternatives; (5) Comparable programs (ThreePeaks, Pacific Quest) have months-long waitlists."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the competitive advantage?",
        "answer": "Nature Up Health's competitive advantages: (1) ONLY program specialized for 7-30 day post-hospitalization window; (2) Gateway's proven 19-year track record + Medi-Cal certification (rare); (3) First-mover in underserved niche; (4) Real estate backing (owned property reduces risk); (5) High barriers to entry (regulatory, operational, relationship-based); (6) Nature-based model is clinically validated and differentiator."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if enrollment is lower than projected?",
        "answer": "Multiple mitigation strategies: (1) Conservative model assumes 70% utilization; even at 60% utilization, investor returns are achieved; (2) CME retreat revenue (healthcare worker burnout program) provides secondary revenue; (3) Gateway has 19-year track record of filling beds; (4) Flexible cohort sizing (scale from 2 to 4 cohorts per month); (5) Phased launch reduces initial ramp-up risk."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if reimbursement rates decline?",
        "answer": "Rate decline mitigation: (1) Diversified payer mix (40% Medi-Cal, 30% insurance, 20% county, 10% grants) reduces single-source risk; (2) 30-year lease locked at current payment rates; (3) Long-term contracts provide some rate protection; (4) CME revenue buffer; (5) Conservative model assumes current rates, so modest declines absorbed; (6) Proactive payer relationship management."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the PropCo/OpCo structure protected?",
        "answer": "PropCo/OpCo protection: (1) Legally binding 30-year lease; (2) Rental payment obligations enforceable regardless of program performance; (3) Property remains asset for PropCo if OpCo fails; (4) Insurance and liability isolated to appropriate entity; (5) Board oversight ensures Gateway performs; (6) If Gateway exits, new operator can be found for same property."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if Gateway walks away?",
        "answer": "Gateway contingency: (1) 30-year lease provides legal recourse; (2) Property reverts to PropCo ownership; (3) Real estate is valuable asset (High Sierra location, infrastructure); (4) Gateway unlikely to exit (nonprofit mission alignment, successful program); (5) Alternative operators available (other nature-based programs); (6) Worst case: property can be sold/refinanced to return capital."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the regulatory risks?",
        "answer": "Regulatory risks and mitigations: (1) Forest Service permit (9-month timeline, 6-12 months actual) - mitigated by early engagement, legal support, $10-25K consulting; (2) State licensing (3-month timeline, Gateway already certified) - low risk; (3) County permits (2-4 weeks) - straightforward; (4) Overall: 30-month integrated timeline, but can operate before final approvals; (5) Legal team onboarded to manage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you scale this model?",
        "answer": "Scaling potential: (1) Model is proven by Gateway across 19 years; (2) Can add cohorts incrementally (start 2/month, scale to 4/month); (3) Multi-site replication possible (other National Forests, other states); (4) CME retreat model independently scalable; (5) Nature-based therapy trend national; (6) Regulatory pathway established once first site succeeds; (7) Financial model improves with scale (fixed costs spread across more revenue)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the exit timeline and liquidity?",
        "answer": "Exit timeline: (1) Years 1-2: Hold and reinvest (no distributions); (2) Years 3-7: Annual distributions ($150K/year); (3) Year 5+: Secondary market sales available to other impact investors; (4) Year 7+: Primary exit options = Gateway buyback (at NOI×6.5x), strategic sale to healthcare real estate firm, or refinance; (5) Total value at Year 7: ~$1.57M (includes NOI distributions and property appreciation); (6) Investors can hold longer for additional returns."
